* For z/OS V1R4, the @VTAMDMP and @VTAMTRC execs for VTAM dump and    *
* trace analysis have been modified for the updated packaging and to  *
* use stubs @VTAMDM1 and @VTAMTR1.                                    *
*                                                                     *
* There are ISPF applications that require keylist support, but do    *
* not provide support by setting ZKLUSE to "Y".  In the past, the     *
* Starter Set has distributed customized vendor execs to provide this *
* support, but in the future, all keylist applications will be        *
* suppoted by creating stubs to enable PFSHOW and KEYLIST support.    *
*                                                                     *

* For MQSeries, there are two different installs.  At MQSeries V5R3   *
* and higher, use the @MQSRS53 exec, and make sure you do NOT use the *
* customized CSQOREXX exec in the Starter Set.  MQSeries added the    *
* STACK parm to their LIBDEFs, so you can use the IBM-supplied        *
* CSQOREXX.  At MQSeries V5R2 and lower, use the new @MQSRS52 exec,   *
* and make sure you do use the customized CSQOREXX exec, which has    *
* been modified to only add STACK to the LIBDEFs.  The PFSHOW and     *
* ZKLUSE settings are now performed in the modified @MQSRIES stub.    *
*                                                                     *

* For the JESx IPCS dialogs, be sure to read the comments regarding   *
* the concatenation of SYS1.SHASPARM and SYS1.SIATPARM to your        *
* default PARMLIB concatenation.                                      *

* For the TCP/IP IPCS dialog, you will have to execute @IPCSTC1 to    *
* begin the IPCS dialog.  In the IPCS dialog, go to IPCS option 6 and *
* enter the @IPCSTC2 command.  In addtion to enabling keylists and    *
* PFSHOW, an EZBDCMDS member has also been created to allow IPCS      *
* commands to be issued from the TCP/IP IPCS dialog.  This will       *
* actually make the dialog usable.                                    *
*                                                                     *
* For ABRALLOC, be sure to change FDRPREF to your FDR prefix and make *
* sure all the dataset names in the PROC statement are correct.       *
*                                                                     *
* For @CA11, be sure to modify the new C11IEXEC for your CA-11        *
* dataset names.  There are three dataset names to be changed on      *
* lines 42, 44, and 47.                                               *

* For $DYNDT12, be sure to NOT include ISR@PUL2, otherwise you will   *
* get duplicate ZSEL logic.  ISR@PUL2 is only required prior to       *
* z/OS V1R2.  For z/OS V1R2 and higher, the selcheck operand of the   *
* selfld directive generates the corrected ZSEL checking code in DTL. *
*                                                                     *
* Be sure to review the $CHANGES member and run a compare between     *
* your exec library and the DISS exec library, then incorporate the   *
