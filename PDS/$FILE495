//***FILE 495 is Tom Conley's Dynamic ISPF Starter Set (DISS), a    *   FILE 495
//*           set of REXX execs to dynamically allocate datasets    *   FILE 495
//*           necessary to run the ISPF interfaces of many common   *   FILE 495
//*           software packages.  This collection of sample execs   *   FILE 495
//*           was designed to make it easier to install these       *   FILE 495
//*           ISPF interfaces, without adding DD names to your      *   FILE 495
//*           installation's LOGON PROCs.  Lots of samples here!    *   FILE 495

//* Dynamic ISPF is a methodology to eliminate ISPF datasets from   *   FILE 495
//* TSO logon procs by using the dynamic allocation functions of    *   FILE 495
//* ISPF and TSO to allocate ISPF application datasets instead.     *   FILE 495

//* This starter set includes REXX execs to invoke many standard    *   FILE 495
