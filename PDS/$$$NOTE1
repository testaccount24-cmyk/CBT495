I am pleased to announce the new V3R5 release of the Dynamic ISPF
Starter Set.  This is a small maintenance release with the
following features:

- New @QMFV6 exec which eliminates the need to use Dynamic
  STEPLIB to support multiple QMF subsystems for QMF V6 and
  higher
- Miscellaneous fixes and documentation enhancements

This release of DISS was made possible by the help and
contributions of the following people and their employers:

Vikesh Bhoola
James Campbell
Eddie Collins at Brookshire Grocery Co.
Alastair Gray at Philip Morris
Jim Halley at Zurich Financial Services
Jim Horne at Lowe's
Bob Iappini at Texaco
Phil Knight at AIG
Bob Lawrence at Boscov's Department Stores LLc
Ken Tomiak at Schunk and Associates
Jerry Whitteridge at Safeway

You can download DISS from my Website below, and it will also be
available soon as FILE495 at www.cbttape.org.  Please let me know
if you have any questions or concerns regarding DISS.
