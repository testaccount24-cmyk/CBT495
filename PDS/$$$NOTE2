I am pleased to announce the new V3R6 release of the Dynamic ISPF
Starter Set.  Now featuring nearly 140 execs, the Starter Set has
some significant new functionality over the previous V3R5
release:

- Support for 9 new applications
    - FDR, ABR, and UPSTREAM from Innovation
    - (E)JES from Phoenix Software
    - IPCS dialogs for TCP/IP and IMS
    - CA's OPERA and TLMS
    - CICS Message Editing Utility
- New DTL sample for z/OS V1R2 enhancements
- Modify IPCS, IPCS/JES2, IPCS/JES3 for multiple
  release support
- Improved error processing for &ZPRIM=NO panels
- Fixes for other applications

Be sure to review the $CHANGES member for all the new release
features.

This release of DISS was made possible by the help and
contributions of the following people and their employers:

Ed Jaffe at Phoenix Software International
Phil Knight at AIG
Fran√óois Le Maner at GIE Loricam
Gilbert Saint-flour at ConvTek

I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Gilbert Saint-flour
for allowing me to develop and test DISS on his P390 platform.
From the first release in June of 2000 until now, Gilbert's P390
has always been there.  I've got my own P390 now and I've
transitioned development and testing over to it, but DISS
wouldn't be what it is today without Gilbert's support these past
two years.  Merci beaucoup, mon ami.

You can download DISS from my Website below, and it will also be
available soon as FILE495 at www.cbttape.org.  Please let me know
if you have any questions or concerns regarding DISS.

If you're reading this from the listserver and you want to be
added to the mailing list, send me an Email and I will add you.
If you wish to be removed from this mailing list, send me an
Email indicating that and I will remove you immediately.
