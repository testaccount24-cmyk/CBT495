/* will not support anyone wishing to use LIBDEF when invoking       */
/* Book Manager READ.  IBM cites four reasons as the basis for       */
/* denying LIBDEF support in BookManager READ.  In a Dynamic ISPF    */
/* environment, only one of the four reasons is valid.  The fourth   */
/* reason listed in PN20713 describes the BookManager "Edit source"  */
/* function.  This function performs a split screen and brings up an */
/* edit session so the user can directly edit the manual they're     */
/* working with.  This function will not work because the LIBDEF's   */
/* are not carried across the split screen.  If you require the      */
/* "Edit source" function in BookManager, you will have to create a  */
/* LOGON proc and hard allocate the BookManager datasets.  If you do */
/* not require the "Edit source" function, this exec will correctly  */
/* invoke BookManager READ, but you do so at your own risk.  IBM     */
/* will not support any dialog errors you encounter unless you have  */
