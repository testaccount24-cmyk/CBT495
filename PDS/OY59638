Note:  I'm leaving this in here just for reference.  The workaround is
       to use the QUEUE command to invoke ISPF.  That will run ISPF
       directly from native TSO instead of running ISPF under REXX.

  ERROR DESCRIPTION:
  Using TSO/E logon proc with a PARM= option that executes a REXX
  exec to take you directly into ISPF and then hitting attention
  from within an authorized command or program may result in
  MSGIKJ56605I ATTENTION INTERRUPTS WILL NOT BE PROCESSED UNITL
  THE FIRST COMMAND FROM THE LOGON PROCEDURE HAS COMPLETED.
  .
  Results may differ when using the TSO/E PLATFORM facility
  ( TSO/E Parmlib member IKJTSOxx with comands and/or programs
  specified in PLATCMD and/or PLATPGM )
  .
  SAMPLE logon PROC used to recreate the problem:
  //JOS320 EXEC PGM=IKJEFT01,
  //             PERFORM=2,
  //             REGION=4096K,
  //             DYNAMNBR=15,
  //             TIME=1440,
  // PARM='EXEC ''JO.EXEC(TESTING)'''
  .
  .
  SAMPLE REXX EXEC USED TO RECREATE PROBLEM:
  /*  REXX EXEC IN JO.EXEC(TESTING)   */
  'ISPF'
  /*  END OF SAMPLE REXX EXEC         */
  .
  STEPS USED TO RECREATE THE PROBLEM:
  1.  Define a user to allow use of the sample logon proc
  2.  Logon to that user.  This will take you directly to
      ISPF main panel.
  3.  From the command line enter:
      TSO TRANSMIT
  4.  You will then be prompted for information for the
      TRANSMIT command.  Hit attention at this prompt
  5.  This results in MSGIKJ56605I
  6.  If you then allow the TRANSMIT command to complete,
      and then retest, you will find that this second
      attention completes as expected.
  .
  When the PLATFORM facility is in effect, entering the command
  repeatedly never allows the attention to complete as expected.
  All attention interrupts of authorized commands and/or programs
  running off the PLATFORM result in MSGIKJ56605I.


  LOCAL FIX:
  Modify logon proc to use a front-end CLIST
