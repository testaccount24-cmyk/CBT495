some significant new functionality over the previous V3R8
release:

    - AbendAid
    - CA-VTAPE
    - CA-Deliver
    - CA-PDSMAN
    - Logrec Viewer
    - XDC
    - XPATH

- Fix bugs in the RMF dialog to add STACK to all LIBDEFs and
allow RMF Primary Option Menu ERB0PRM to process nested menu
selections

- Modify $DYNMENU to circumvent the 126-pair limit for the TRANS
  function
- Modify TSOLOGON for better comments
- Modify @ISHELL to add keylist support
- Modify @FFST for IBM standard dataset names
- Modify @DITTO to free DITPROF file allocated by DITTO command
  processor
- Modify @VIEW to use ZTRAIL for passing the VIEW database name
