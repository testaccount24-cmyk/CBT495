*              Add a customized CSQOREXX exec and modify @MQSRIES to  *

*              Add a modified copy of CA-JCLCHECK's JCKSPF CLIST to   *
*              the starter set.  The modified CLIST adds PASSLIB to   *
*              the SELECT NEWAPPL statement so the LIBDEF's in        *
*              @JCLCHEK get passed into the CA-JCLCHECK CLISTs.       *
*                                                                     *
*              Modify the @SYNCMSG exec to add documentation for the  *

*                                                                     *
*              Modify @CTLGSOL to add missing 'SELECT' verb.          *

*              Modify @IPCSMNU to add extra ALTLIB statements (like   *
*              IPCS CLIST BLSCALTL) before invoking the BLSPPRIM      *
*              selection menu.  This fixes a bug where the utility    *
*              options 3.1 and 3.2 would fail for "COMMAND NOT        *
*              FOUND".  Thanks to Connie Marks at ATOS Origin, Inc.   *

*              Modify the @ISMF and @RMM execs to check the OS/390    *
*              release and allocate the appropriate datasets.  This   *

*              Modify the following execs to remove SEOYSENU, which   *
*              is not an ISPF skeleton library:                       *
*                                                                     *

*              Add the following exec submitted by Eddie Collins at   *
*              Brookshire Grocery Co.:                                *
*                                                                     *

*              Modify all execs to include SCRNAME on the SELECT      *
*              statement in the exec rather than the SELECT statement *
*              in the ISPF menu.  This will allow a SCRNAME to be set *
*              for sites using "TSO @exec" or a command table entry   *
*              to invoke the exec.  This suggestion was submitted by  *
*              William Kim Mongan at Basler Versicherungen.  The      *
*              following execs were NOT modified because they use TSO *
*              CALL instead of ISPEXEC SELECT (@IPCSMNU was not       *
*              modified because SCRNAME is set by the exec invoking   *
*              @IPCSMNU):                                             *
