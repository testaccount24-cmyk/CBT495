Dynamic ISPF is a methodology to eliminate ISPF datasets from TSO logon
procs by using the dynamic allocation functions of ISPF and TSO to
allocate ISPF application datasets instead.  For more information about
Dynamic ISPF, download Tom Conley's Dynamic ISPF SHARE presentation at
http://home.roadrunner.com/~pinncons.

This starter set includes REXX execs to invoke many standard ISPF
applications.  If you have any problems, suggestions, or to contribute
an exec of yours, please Email Tom Conley:

This exec library will be updated periodically and reposted at:
